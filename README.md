# UsersAndTeams - Test

I decided to do task 2, although I added a remove member feature like was asked for in task 1.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.6.

## Steps to run locally

1. Download dependencies `npm install`.
2. Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. This opens a browser and navigates to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
